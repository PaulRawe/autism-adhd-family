    <h2>The Fight for a School Aide</h2>
    <p>Before Sam started school, my wife recognized early – due to her educational background – how important a school aide would be for him.</p>
    <p>She – though I didn't see it as clearly then – knew: Sam needs help at school. If that doesn't work from the start, school could fail immediately.</p>
    <p>So she applied in good time before school enrollment for a school aide from the responsible agency.</p>
    <p>The first response from the agency?</p>
    <p><strong>"Sam doesn't need a school aide because he's not in school yet."</strong></p>
    <p>Boom. That simple. A classic bureaucratic circle: You need help to manage school, but you don't get help because you're not in school yet.</p>
    <p>But we didn't give up.</p>
    <p>My wife followed up, submitted forms, made phone calls, organized evaluations – and in the end, Sam actually stood there on his first day of school with a school aide.</p>
    <p>And that was important. Really important.</p>
    <div class="quote">Sometimes you have to fight for things that should be self-evident – especially when it comes to your child's education.</div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why the School Aide Is So Important</h2>
    <p>The school aide gives Sam the structure he needs to manage the school day.</p>
    <p>She's not just an additional supervisor. She's his point of contact, his orientation, his calm anchor in an often loud and chaotic school environment.</p>
    <p>She helps him understand tasks, get organized, take breaks when it's too much, and avoid or resolve conflicts with other children.</p>
    <p>Without her, school would be constant overwhelm for Sam.</p>
    <p>With her, he has a chance to manage there – not perfectly, not always easily, but manageable.</p>

    <h2>The Morning Meeting</h2>
    <p>Every morning we meet the school aide at the same spot, at the same time.</p>
    <p>Always the same meeting point. Always the same time. Always the same routine.</p>
    <p>That might sound trivial, but for Sam it's essential.</p>
    <p>Before he goes into school, he says goodbye to us – with an extended goodbye ritual. Every time. Without exception.</p>
    <p>We briefly confer with the school aide: How was the night? Were there any problems? What should she watch for today?</p>
    <p>Then Sam's school day begins.</p>
    <p>For him, the day doesn't start with entering the classroom but with this morning ritual. It gives him security. It gives him orientation. It tells him: Everything is going according to plan.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>No Full Day – And Why That's Okay</h2>
    <p>Since Sam can't do full-day school because it's simply too loud there, we pick him up earlier – again at the same spot.</p>
    <p>Full-day care with many children, loud noises, changing activities, and few retreat options wouldn't be manageable for him.</p>
    <p>So we decided against it.</p>
    <p>At pickup, we briefly discuss with the school aide whether anything special happened, how the day went, whether there were challenges.</p>
    <p>Then we go home. Always the same routine.</p>

    <h2>What the Science Says (Brief & Understandable)</h2>
    <p>School aides (also called educational assistants or paraprofessionals) are proven to significantly support autistic students' school participation and learning success.</p>
    <p><strong>Fixed routines and rituals</strong> at school transitions (arrival, departure) reduce anxiety and increase predictability.</p>
    <p><strong>Consistent communication</strong> between parents and aide enables better regulation and early intervention when problems arise.</p>
    <p><strong>Environmental adaptation</strong> (like avoiding full-day programs when sensory overload is an issue) is a form of reasonable accommodation under disability law.</p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you have to fight for what should be a given.</p>
    <p>A school aide isn't a luxury – it's often the difference between school working or failing.</p>
    <p>And consistency? It's not rigidity. It's security.</p>
