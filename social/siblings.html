    <h2>Our Daily Life – Honest, Warm, and Sometimes Very Challenging</h2>
    <p>Having a sister wasn't easy for Sam at first at all.</p>
    <p>Suddenly he had to wait. Suddenly he sometimes came second. Especially when I was working and there simply weren't enough adults to constantly perceive and adequately accompany him.</p>
    <p>For Sam this meant: less attention, less control, more internal tension.</p>
    <p>This went very far at times. It led to violent outbursts against his sister and statements like: "I wish Johanna had never been born."</p>
    <p>These are statements that hurt. And yet they say more about overwhelm than real rejection.</p>
    <div class="quote">Sibling love doesn't grow automatically – it needs time, protection, and guidance.</div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Development Takes Time – On Both Sides</h2>
    <p>With Johanna's increasing age, the relationship between the two has also changed.</p>
    <p>The more independent she became, the better she could communicate, the more their relationship grew.</p>
    <p>Today there's closeness. There are shared moments. And there's genuine affection.</p>
    <p>What hasn't worked – and still doesn't work today (Sam is currently 7, Johanna 4) – is playing together alone.</p>
    <p>An adult must always be nearby. Not for control, but for early perception.</p>
    <p>Because Sam doesn't draw his boundary quietly. When it becomes too much for him, sudden violent explosions occur.</p>
    <p>And his little sister is completely helpless against this.</p>
    <p>Right now, Johanna also tends to trigger Sam consciously or unconsciously. Not from malicious intent – but from childish curiosity and lack of understanding.</p>
    <div class="quote">Children don't provoke to harm – but because they're still learning.</div>

    <h2>How We Try to Protect Both Children</h2>
    <p>Together with the therapists, we've tried to gently introduce Johanna to the topic of "special children."</p>
    <p>Through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read-aloud stories</li>
        <li>Conversations</li>
        <li>Simple explanations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>She knows today that Sam is different. That he's more quickly overwhelmed. And that he doesn't do things on purpose.</p>
    <p>But: Intellectually she's simply not yet advanced enough to really understand or categorize all of this.</p>
    <p>That's why we repeat a lot. Again and again.</p>
    <p>When it becomes too much, we intervene. And after difficult situations, we calmly discuss with her what happened and how it might be done better next time.</p>
    <p>Without blame. Without pressure. But with clarity.</p>

    <h2>What the Science Says (Brief & Understandable)</h2>
    <p>Siblings of autistic children often face special challenges.</p>
    <p><strong>Studies show:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased emotional burden</li>
        <li>Role conflicts</li>
        <li>Simultaneous closeness and overwhelm</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>At the same time, siblings often benefit long-term from:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>High empathy capacity</li>
        <li>Social sensitivity</li>
        <li>Differentiated perception</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What's crucial is that all children are protected and that they're not expected to regulate situations alone that overwhelm them.</p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
    <p>Sibling relationships in the autism context are often complex. And rarely "simple."</p>
    <p>They need: Time. Guidance. And above all protection – for everyone involved.</p>
    <p>Closeness may grow. But safety always has priority.</p>
