    <h2>The First Years – Lots of Contact, Little Structure</h2>
    <p>Initially we met with many parents and their children. Mainly my wife, since I was usually working. So there were always other children around – and Sam got along with them well at first.</p>
    <p>It worked especially well when everything went according to his rules.</p>
    <p>What we didn't know yet: You have to prepare such situations. You have to prepare, explain, structure.</p>
    <p>That was missing.</p>
    <p>Sudden announcements like "We're leaving now" or meal breaks without advance notice were basically doomed to fail from the start.</p>
    <p>Looking back, we have to say: <strong>We parents were a significant part of the problem in many escalations.</strong></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, some friends were also lost along the way.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Learning Through Experience – And Through Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Over time we learned: When we announce things in advance, explain routines, and prepare transitions, social interaction works significantly better.</p>
    <p>After the diagnosis, it became noticeably easier.</p>
    <p>Not because Sam changed – but because we understood him better.</p>
    <p>On vacation, for example (in Holland on the coast), Sam often makes contact with other children very quickly. He plays, laughs, is right in the middle and visibly having fun.</p>
    <p>But even there: Always coupled with clear rules, manageable situations, and familiar routines.</p>

    <h2>School, Acceptance, and Reality</h2>
    <p>At school, everyone knows that Sam is a "special child." This is openly stated and basically accepted.</p>
    <p>Whether his classmates meet privately, we don't know exactly. What we do know: Sam has very few friends.</p>
    <p>About every two months he's invited by a girl from his class. He also occasionally goes to birthday parties.</p>
    <p>Otherwise it's rather quiet.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we meet with a boy from daycare days. The two really get along well.</p>
    <p>Compared to his sister, however, Sam can't stay alone somewhere else for long – or sometimes not at all.</p>
    <p>This isn't a question of wanting, but of capacity.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Being Alone Isn't the Same as Loneliness</h2>
    <p>What you shouldn't forget: Sam plays a lot alone at home. And he's happy doing it.</p>
    <p>He plays with his sister. With us. Or completely by himself.</p>
    <p>He doesn't constantly need other children to be content.</p>
    <p>Few, reliable contacts are more valuable to him than many changing ones.</p>
    <div class="quote">Being alone can be a need – not a deficit.</div>

    <h2>Our Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Friendships need preparation</li>
        <li>Spontaneity is often overwhelming for Sam</li>
        <li>Clear rules create security</li>
        <li>Fewer contacts, but stable ones</li>
        <li>Parental guidance isn't a disadvantage, but a prerequisite</li>
        <li>Being alone can be a need – not a deficit</li>

    <h2>What the Science Says (Brief & Understandable)</h2>
    <p>Studies show that children on the autism spectrum fundamentally have social interest, but often have difficulties with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Social subtle cues (facial expressions, tone, implicit rules)</li>
        <li>Spontaneous adaptation to changing situations</li>
        <li>Group interactions without clear structure</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Friendships therefore often develop:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>More slowly</li>
        <li>More deliberately</li>
        <li>With stronger support from adults</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the same time, studies prove that many autistic children prefer few but very stable relationships. These relationships are emotionally highly significant for them and contribute significantly to well-being and self-esteem.</p>
    <p>Additionally, studies show that withdrawal or solitary play doesn't automatically mean social isolation. For many children on the autism spectrum, being alone is a form of self-regulation and serves to maintain emotional stability.</p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
    <p>Friendships with autism work differently. But not worse.</p>
    <p>They need more preparation. More structure. More reliability.</p>
    <p>And they need parents who understand that sometimes less is more.</p>
