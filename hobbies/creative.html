    <h2>Building, Organizing, Structuring</h2>

    <p>
        Sam builds. A lot and intensively.
    </p>

    <p>
        With LEGO, complex constructions emerge – often not following instructions, but according to his own systems. Every piece has its place, every color has its meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
        With building blocks, he creates huge, symmetric structures. Hundreds of wooden blocks, stacked for hours. Precise. Deliberate. Perfectly balanced.
    </p>

    <p>
        What sometimes looks like simple play to us is real work for Sam. He plans, constructs, experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
        And when something doesn't fit, it's not accepted – it gets changed until it's right.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        In his structures, Sam has control. There, everything makes sense.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The World of Board Games – Used Differently</h2>

    <p>
        Sam loves board games. But not necessarily to play them by the rules.
    </p>

    <p>
        He frequently takes all his board games and distributes the contents in an organized way throughout his room.
    </p>

    <p>
        Figures are sorted, cards laid out, game pieces grouped by color.
    </p>

    <p>
        To an outsider, it looks like chaos. To Sam, it's perfect order – one that only he understands.
    </p>

    <p>
        And he immediately notices if even a single piece is missing or has been moved.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is his way of working with materials. Not wrong – just different.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Crafting – With All the Senses</h2>

    <p>
        Sam enjoys crafting a lot. There's cutting, gluing, folding, building.
    </p>

    <p>
        Often things emerge that follow a certain logic – his logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes they're recreations from paper and cardboard, inspired by his special interests. Sometimes they're abstract constructions that only make sense to him.
    </p>

    <p>
        We've learned not to ask "What's this supposed to be?" – but to say "Show me what you're making."
    </p>

    <p>
        Because often Sam has a plan. And often this plan is brilliant – just not immediately recognizable at first glance.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Drawing – A Long Journey to Representation</h2>

    <p>
        Drawing was a challenge for Sam for a long time.
    </p>

    <p>
        He only started drawing recognizable things at almost six years old.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before that, it was mainly lines, patterns, structures – but no objects or figures.
    </p>

    <p>
        That was sometimes hard for us as parents to accept. Other children were already drawing houses, trees, and people at three or four years old.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sam drew systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        But when he started drawing concretely, it was impressive. Detailed. Precise. With an incredible eye for proportions and structures.
    </p>

    <p>
        He had to learn it his way – and that worked.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Sometimes it just takes longer. And sometimes the result is all the more impressive.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why Creative Activities Are So Important</h2>

    <p>
        Creativity is more than just a hobby for Sam. It's a form of communication, processing, and self-regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        When he builds, he organizes his thoughts. When he draws, he expresses what words cannot. When he crafts, he creates something he has control over.
    </p>

    <p>
        These activities help him reduce stress, concentrate, and be with himself.
    </p>

    <p>
        And they give him the opportunity to experience success – in a protected space, without evaluation, without time pressure.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What the Science Says</h2>

    <p>
        Creative activities have demonstrably positive effects for autistic children and children with ADHD:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-regulation:</strong> Drawing and building help process emotions and reduce stress</li>
        <li><strong>Fine motor skills:</strong> Crafting, drawing, and constructing promote hand-eye coordination</li>
        <li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Creative activities enable flow states and support attention</li>
        <li><strong>Self-efficacy:</strong> Creating one's own works strengthens self-confidence</li>
        <li><strong>Nonverbal communication:</strong> Creativity offers means of expression beyond language</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Studies show that autistic children often have special strengths in visual-spatial areas. Building, constructing, and detailed drawing come particularly naturally to many autistic children.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's important that creative activities are offered <strong>without performance pressure</strong>. It's not about creating something "beautiful," but about giving the child space for expression and processing.

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    <p>
        Creativity has many faces. Not every child draws colorful pictures with sun and house.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some children build systems. Others organize game pieces. Still others only draw recognizable things at six – and then with incredible precision.
    </p>

    <p>
        What's important is that the child gets the opportunity to express themselves creatively – in their own way.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Creativity isn't what comes out. Creativity is the process where the child is with themselves.
