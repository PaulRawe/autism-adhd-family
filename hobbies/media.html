    <h2>When Interest Emerges, We Open Up the World</h2>

    <p>
        When Sam shows interest in something, he's allowed to watch educational shows, films, tutorials, and documentaries about it on his phone or tablet.
    </p>

    <p>
        We read texts to him about it. He listens to audiobook stories that deepen his topics.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's not about consumption. It's about <strong>deepening</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Sam, media aren't a pastime – they're a tool to gather, structure, and internalize knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        And he uses them with an intensity that's impressive.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>From Cleopatra to Greek Mythology</h2>

    <p>
        What particularly interested Sam in the past was Cleopatra and her story, as well as the history of Egypt.
    </p>

    <p>
        He worked through documentaries, we read books to him, he watched videos – over and over again.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, he listens to and watches everything about Greek mythology.
    </p>

    <p>
        Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades – he knows their stories, their relationships, their conflicts. He knows who's related to whom, which Titans ruled before the gods, and which heroes fulfilled which tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
        He's an <strong>absolute expert</strong> in his areas of interest.
    </p>

    <p>
        He knows the names, backgrounds, and stories as if he's memorized them word for word.
    </p>

    <p>
        And he probably has.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Sam has a way of processing knowledge that's fascinating – he doesn't learn, he absorbs.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How We Use Media Intentionally</h2>

    <p>
        Media aren't a babysitter in our house. They're a <strong>learning instrument</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Sam is interested in a topic, we specifically search for:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Documentaries and educational shows</li>
        <li>Audiobooks and educational stories</li>
        <li>Videos that explain complex connections</li>
        <li>Tutorials and explanatory videos</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        We often watch together. We talk about what we've seen. We deepen.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sam doesn't use media passively – he uses them <em>actively</em> to expand his knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        And that works excellently.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Balance Between Fostering and Limiting</h2>

    <p>
        Of course, we have rules too. Media time isn't unlimited.
    </p>

    <p>
        But we clearly distinguish between mindless entertainment and targeted learning.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Sam watches a one-hour documentary about ancient Greece, that's something different for us than if he randomly flips through videos.
    </p>

    <p>
        We encourage one. We limit the other.
    </p>

    <p>
        And Sam understands this difference very well by now.
    </p>
</section>

    <h2>What the Science Says</h2>

    <p>
        Media can – when used correctly – enable enormous learning progress for autistic children and children with ADHD:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visual learning:</strong> Many autistic children learn better through images and videos than through language alone</li>
        <li><strong>Self-directed pace:</strong> Media allow content to be repeated, paused, and processed at one's own pace</li>
        <li><strong>Interest-based learning:</strong> Children learn best when intrinsically motivated</li>
        <li><strong>Depth of detail:</strong> Documentaries and educational films offer the level of detail that many autistic children seek</li>
        <li><strong>Stress-free knowledge transfer:</strong> No social demands, no overwhelm from group learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Studies show that autistic children often have an exceptionally good memory for details, especially in their special interests. This strength can be optimally fostered through targeted media use.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's important that media use is <strong>accompanied and reflected upon</strong>. Watching together, conversations about content, and linking with other forms of learning reinforce the positive effect.

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    <p>
        Media aren't the enemy. They're a tool.
    </p>

    <p>
        What matters is <em>how</em> they're used.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Sam learns, deepens, and understands through media, then they're a blessing.
    </p>

    <p>
        When he drifts through them and consumes without processing, then they're a problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        We've learned to look closely and distinguish.
