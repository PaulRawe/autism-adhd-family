    <h2>What We Tried</h2>

    <p>
        Initially, we took Sam to tennis. Seemed reasonable – movement, coordination, maybe some social contacts too.
    </p>

    <p>
        It didn't work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Later we went weekly to gymnastics and active play groups. Lots of kids, lots of action, lots of movement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Too loud. Too chaotic. Too unpredictable.
    </p>

    <p>
        We tried inline skating. That didn't quite work either.
    </p>

    <p>
        The traditional sports offerings that work for many children just didn't fit Sam.
    </p>

    <p>
        Too many stimuli. Too many people. Too many unpredictable situations.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Not every child needs the soccer league – sometimes they just need a different path to movement.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What Works: The Trampoline</h2>

    <p>
        What Sam absolutely loves is jumping on the trampoline. For hours.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's repetitive, predictable, and simultaneously intense. He can completely wear himself out there without anyone else being involved.
    </p>

    <p>
        No rules that change. No teammates who react unpredictably. No coaches giving instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just Sam, the trampoline, and movement.
    </p>

    <p>
        That works.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Living Room Obstacle Course Show</h2>

    <p>
        Additionally, Sam acts out shows he's watched during rest time – with full physical commitment.
    </p>

    <p>
        He runs, jumps, and does gymnastics through the living room, over the couch, and back again.
    </p>

    <p>
        To outsiders, it might look chaotic. For Sam, it's a form of processing and exercise at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        He moves while reenacting the stories. He processes impressions while jumping.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is his way of combining both – and it works perfectly for him.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Why Movement Is So Important</h2>

    <p>
        In the end, I have to say: physical activity is incredibly important for wearing him out.
    </p>

    <p>
        When Sam doesn't get enough movement, we notice immediately. He becomes more restless, more irritable, more tense.
    </p>

    <p>
        Movement helps him reduce stress, process impressions, and regulate his body.
    </p>

    <p>
        It doesn't have to be the traditional sports club. It doesn't have to be soccer or gymnastics.
    </p>

    <p>
        It just has to <em>work</em> – for that particular child.
    </p>

    <p>
        For Sam, it's the trampoline and the living room obstacle course. And that's enough.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What the Science Says</h2>

    <p>
        Movement and sports have demonstrably positive effects for autistic children and children with ADHD on:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stress regulation</strong> and emotional stability</li>
        <li><strong>Attention</strong> and concentration ability</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep quality</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Self-regulation</strong> and impulse control</li>
        <li><strong>Sensory processing</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Studies show that especially <strong>repetitive forms of movement</strong> like trampolining or swimming work well for autistic children because they:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>are predictable</li>
        <li>work without social complexity</li>
        <li>provide intense sensory stimulation</li>
        <li>can be self-regulated in dosage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        It's important that the form of movement fits the child – not the other way around. Forcing or overwhelming in group settings can be counterproductive.
    </p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    <p>
        Sports don't have to follow a fixed pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes the backyard trampoline is worth more than any soccer league.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes the couch obstacle course show after a TV episode is exactly what the child needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's not about meeting societal expectations. It's about the child moving – in their own way.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        The best sport is the one the child does voluntarily – and feels happy doing.
