    <h2>The Difficult Early Years</h2>

    <p>
        Sam's toddler years were not easy for me as a father.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've mentioned it elsewhere: Sam sometimes cried for up to three hours straight, woke up at least every two hours at night, and during the day was often impossible to calm.
    </p>

    <p>
        And I didn't know why.
    </p>

    <p>
        This not knowing repeatedly put me in situations that led to confrontations. To raised voices. And unfortunately, to words I'm not proud of today.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted things to work. I wanted him to "cooperate." I wanted him to understand.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was the adult, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
        But that was exactly the problem: <strong>I had no solutions, only expectations.</strong>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Internal Conflict</h2>

    <p>
        At the end of such days, I kept telling myself: This isn't who I want to be.
    </p>

    <p>
        And at the same time, I didn't know how to do it differently.
    </p>

    <p>
        When my wife suggested getting Sam evaluated, my first reaction was rejection.
    </p>

    <p>
        I thought it was "totally wrong."
    </p>

    <p>
        In my mind, it meant:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a label</li>
        <li>a box</li>
        <li>a lifelong stigma</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I was afraid something would be "forced" on him.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Real Turning Point</h2>

    <p>
        Looking back, I have to say clearly: <strong>That diagnosis was the game changer.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Not for Sam – but for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Suddenly the behavior had a framework. An explanation. A context.
    </p>

    <p>
        I could specifically engage with the topic, educate myself, and adjust my own behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        No longer from gut instinct, but with understanding.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>When Understanding Replaces Guilt</h2>

    <p>
        With knowledge came change. With change came relief.
    </p>

    <p>
        The situation at home became calmer. More structured. More predictable.
    </p>

    <p>
        And with it, something disappeared that had accompanied me for a long time: guilt.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not because I became perfect. But because I understood why things escalate – and how to prevent them.
    </p>

    <p>
        "I was mean today" eventually stopped being a daily theme.
    </p>

    <p>
        Not because there are no more difficult days, but because there are options for action.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Guilt often arises where knowledge is lacking. Understanding doesn't create perfection – but it creates a new way of dealing with things.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What the Science Says</h2>

    <p>
        Parents of children on the autism spectrum report significantly more often of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>chronic stress</li>
        <li>feeling overwhelmed</li>
        <li>feelings of guilt and failure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Studies show these feelings don't arise from lack of parental competence, but from:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>lack of knowledge</li>
        <li>persistent sleep deprivation</li>
        <li>repeated escalations without explanation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Research also proves that early diagnosis and psychoeducational support for parents not only helps the child, but significantly increases parental self-efficacy.
    </p>

    <p>
        With growing understanding, guilt decreases while empathy, regulation, and relationship quality increase.
    </p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    <p>Guilt is a sign of responsibility. But it's not a good guide.</p>
    
    <p>Knowledge, structure, and understanding don't replace perfect parenting – but they create a better foundation.</p>
    
    <p>And sometimes the most important step isn't doing everything right, but understanding why it goes wrong.</p>
