    <h2>Two Worlds, One Goal</h2>

    <p>
        My wife is a full-blooded educator. Academic knowledge about child development and education.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm an ICU nurse. Confident, but inexperienced in pedagogy.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can probably imagine there were frequent differences in parenting approaches.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I also learned: You don't always have to be right; you can always learn something.
    </p>

    <p>
        That's why I fully incorporated my wife's opinions and knowledge – ultimately with success.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        This shows: When you don't agree, that's okay. Accept it. Value it.
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>In Front of the Kids: Stand Together</h2>

    <p>
        Each of you enriches the other. See it that way too.
    </p>

    <p>
        In front of the kids, it's important that you stand together – even if behind closed doors you disagree.
    </p>

    <p>
        This gives children security and avoids uncertainty or playing parents against each other.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Yes, You're Allowed to Be Frustrated</h2>

    <p>
        Yes, you're allowed to be frustrated with your kids.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my opinion, this lowers your own stress level and increases your resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's not shameful to also say: "Today was really exhausting."
    </p>

    <p>
        On the contrary – it's relieving and honest.
    </p>

    <h2>When Couple Time Becomes Rare</h2>

    <p>
        Especially in our situation, where Sam can essentially only be safely cared for by one grandparent and either one or the other of us is working, things like dates are a huge challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
        We've had weeks or days where we maybe saw each other for 20 minutes a day without kids.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Take time to deliberately hug each other. Show that you're there.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since I've been better understanding how Sam works and getting along with him much better, couple time is coming back.
    </p>

    <p>
        It won't be perfect. But it becomes more manageable.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How We Make Time as a Couple</h2>

    <p>
        We try in the evenings, when the kids are in bed, to limit talking about the kids to a maximum of 5 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that comes us. Our topics. Our thoughts. Not as parents, but as a couple.
    </p>

    <p>
        On free weekends, we watch a movie together.
    </p>

    <p>
        When we're out with the kids, we enjoy it when they're playing in the woods or just running around on the playground.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then we have time to sit next to each other, talk – or just breathe together.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Couple time doesn't have to be big or planned. Sometimes a quiet moment on the park bench is enough.

    <h2>What the Science Says</h2>

    <p>
        Parents of children on the autism spectrum often experience increased relationship stress, particularly through:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>different coping strategies</li>
        <li>little shared time</li>
        <li>different parenting approaches</li>
        <li>chronic stress from caregiving demands</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Studies show that <strong>mutual appreciation, open communication, and shared responsibility</strong> are crucial for relationship stability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Couples who see themselves as a team and view their different competencies as enrichment have significantly higher relationship satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Small gestures of connection – like brief hugs or conscious moments together – can demonstrably reduce stress and strengthen emotional bonding.
    </p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    <p>
        Solidarity doesn't come from perfection, but from honesty.
    </p>

    <p>
        From accepting differences. And from the willingness to support each other – even when you're at the end of your rope yourself.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        You don't have to always agree. But you should always be there for each other.
