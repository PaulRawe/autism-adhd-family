    <h2>For Me, One of the Hardest Things Ever</h2>

    <p>
        Accepting help – for me, one of the hardest things ever.
    </p>

    <p>
        After all, I was more or less completely on my own at 16 and had to manage everything myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        That attitude runs deep. For years I thought: Whoever accepts help is weak. Whoever manages everything alone is strong.
    </p>

    <p>
        But that's not true.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whoever accepts help isn't weak – they're smart enough to recognize that you get further together.
    </p>

    <h2>The Help We Received</h2>

    <p>
        We really got great help to better understand Sam.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sam received very intensive therapy where a therapist came to us twice a week and worked with him on:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>What are feelings?</li>
        <li>How does the other person feel?</li>
        <li>How do I react in certain situations?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        For many situations, there were social stories that helped Sam better understand the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        And we as parents also received regular training from the therapy team.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, we received a lot of informational materials that really helped.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        This support wasn't just important for Sam – it was crucial for us as parents too.
    </div>

    <h2>Family Therapy – An Outside Perspective</h2>

    <p>
        Currently, we're doing family therapy. It takes place once a month and it really helps a lot.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's totally important to have someone from the outside who isn't emotionally caught up in it, to assess the family situation and help at the right points through good counseling.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you're standing in the middle of the storm, you often can't see clearly anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
        A neutral outside view helps recognize patterns, develop strategies, and not get lost in daily life.
    </p>

    <p>
        This therapy isn't a weakness – it's a tool. And it works.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    <p>
        Accepting help doesn't mean you've failed.
    </p>

    <p>
        It means you're willing to learn, grow, and do the best for your child.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through therapy, we better understood Sam. And through family therapy, we better understood ourselves as a family.
    </p>

    <p>
        We couldn't have done that alone.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Accepting help isn't defeat – it's the first step toward change.

    <h2>What the Science Says</h2>

    <p>
        Parents of children on the autism spectrum demonstrably benefit from professional support.
    </p>

    <p>
        Studies show that:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parent training</strong> increases competence in dealing with challenging behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Social stories</strong> improve understanding of social situations in autistic children</li>
        <li><strong>Family therapy</strong> significantly facilitates communication and living together</li>
        <li><strong>External perspectives</strong> help break through stuck patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Families who seek professional help report:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>more security in daily life</li>
        <li>less stress and overwhelm</li>
        <li>better relationship with the child</li>
        <li>more understanding of the child's behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Final Thought</h2>

    <p>
        If you're reading this and thinking: "But I have to manage this alone" – then I'm telling you:
    </p>

    <p>
        No, you don't.
    </p>

    <p>
        And it's also not a sign of weakness when you accept help.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        It's a sign of strength to recognize when you need support – and to get it.
