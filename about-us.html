        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p><em>Who we are and why we created this website</em></p>

        <h2>Our Family</h2>
        <p>We're Paul and Katharina, parents to Sam (7 years old, autism & ADHD) and his younger sister Johanna (4 years old).</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Paul:</strong> ICU nurse, pragmatic problem-solver, often the "wait and see" voice</p>
            <p><strong>Katharina:</strong> Elementary school teacher, early recognizer of Sam's needs, tireless advocate</p>
            <p><strong>Sam:</strong> 7 years old, diagnosed with autism and ADHD, loves Minecraft and structure</p>
            <p><strong>Johanna:</strong> 4 years old, Sam's little sister, learning to understand her brother</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Sam's diagnosis didn't come as a complete surprise to Katharina - her professional background as a teacher helped her recognize the signs early. For me (Paul), it took longer to understand what autism and ADHD really meant for our daily life.</p>
        
        <p>We've learned through trial and error, countless therapy sessions, bureaucratic battles (like getting Sam's school aide approved), and many sleepless nights.</p>
        
        <p>But we've also learned what works - and that's what we want to share.</p>

        <h2>Why This Website?</h2>
        <p>When Sam was diagnosed, we searched desperately for practical, honest information from other parents. We found:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Academic research (valuable, but often hard to apply)</li>
            <li>Clinical guidelines (important, but not daily-life focused)</li>
            <li>Inspirational stories (nice, but not always realistic)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What we rarely found:</strong> Real, detailed descriptions of what actually works in daily life. The unglamorous routines. The specific times. The failures and adjustments.</p>
        
        <p>That's what we want to provide.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>This website contains:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px;">
                <li>✓ Specific routines with actual times and details</li>
                <li>✓ What worked, what didn't, and why</li>
                <li>✓ Honest about challenges - no sugar-coating</li>
                <li>✓ Practical solutions you can try today</li>
                <li>✓ Real experiences from real parents</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>What We're Not</h2>
        <p>Important to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We're <strong>not</strong> medical professionals (though we work with many)</li>
            <li>We're <strong>not</strong> therapists (though Sam has excellent ones)</li>
            <li>We're <strong>not</strong> saying our way is the only way</li>
            <li>We're <strong>not</strong> claiming perfection - we make mistakes daily</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We're parents who've figured out some things through experience, and we want to share what we've learned with other families who might benefit.</p>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>Throughout this website, you'll notice some patterns in how we handle things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure over spontaneity:</strong> Predictability is Sam's foundation</li>
            <li><strong>Acceptance over optimization:</strong> Not everything needs to be "fixed"</li>
            <li><strong>Pragmatism over idealism:</strong> What works matters more than what "should" work</li>
            <li><strong>Honesty over perfection:</strong> Real life is messy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why We Share Personal Details</h2>
        <p>You'll find very specific information on this website - medication names, exact times, personal struggles. We share this because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generic advice often doesn't help</li>
            <li>Specific examples give you concrete starting points</li>
            <li>Knowing others struggle with the same things reduces isolation</li>
            <li>Details make strategies actually implementable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We've changed no names - this is our real family, our real experiences.</p>

        <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
        <p>On this website you'll find:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Life:</strong> 10 pages on routines, meltdowns, meals, bedtime, and more</li>
            <li><strong>School:</strong> 6 pages on disclosure, homework, teacher collaboration, and support</li>
            <li><strong>Social Life:</strong> 5 pages on friendships, siblings, birthdays, and family</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Each page includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What we actually do (with specific details)</li>
            <li>Why it works (or doesn't)</li>
            <li>Research context (when relevant)</li>
            <li>Real challenges we still face</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A Note on Research</h2>
        <p>While we cite research where relevant, this website is fundamentally about <strong>lived experience</strong>. Science informs our approach, but daily reality shapes it.</p>
        
        <p>Every child is different. What works for Sam might not work for your child. But knowing what others tried - and how they adapted it - can give you ideas and hope.</p>

        <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
        <p>Have questions? Want to share your own experiences? We'd love to hear from you:</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> rawe.p@freenet.de</p>
        
        <p>We read every message, though we may not be able to respond to all individually.</p>

        <h2>Thank You</h2>
        <p>Thank you for visiting our website. If even one family finds one strategy that makes their day a little easier, this project has been worth it.</p>
        
        <p>You're doing a great job. Parenting is hard. Parenting a neurodivergent child is harder. You're showing up, learning, adapting - that's everything.</p>
