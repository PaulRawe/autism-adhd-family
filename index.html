    <h2>Meet Sam – From Dad's Perspective</h2>

    <div class="intro-grid">
        <div class="intro-text">
            <p>
                Sam is 7 years old now. A lively, curious boy with a huge heart, 
                endless curiosity, and a very special way of seeing the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the beginning, everything was more intense with Sam. As a baby, 
                he cried for hours – not because something was missing, but because 
                <em>everything was too much</em>. Sounds, smells, touches – unfiltered, 
                simultaneous, overwhelming. We held him, cuddled, gave warmth and security 
                as best we could.
            </p>

            <p>
                At one year old, he was already walking and speaking his first sentences. 
                At two, he knew all his letters – self-taught – and began reading. 
                Books were his great love. Hours of listening to stories, studying pictures, 
                absorbing everything.
            </p>

            <p>
                Daycare at eighteen months was hard for him. Without us, in that loud, 
                chaotic environment, he was often overwhelmed. But at the same time, 
                he showed how much was in him: He explained pumps, colors, technology 
                to other kids. And he loved lining things up – sometimes over sixty feet long.
            </p>

            <p>
                At four came the many doctor visits, tests, conversations. Then the diagnosis: 
                Autism and ADHD. Suddenly so much had a name. We began adapting our daily 
                life – structure, predictability, rituals. That gave Sam security.
            </p>

            <p>
                His emotions are huge. When he laughs, his whole face beams. When he's angry, 
                it's like a storm – uncontrollable, overwhelming. Especially when something 
                goes differently than discussed. Then he hits or throws things. We've learned 
                to recognize the signs and help him come back down.
            </p>

            <p>
                At school he has an aide who guides him through the day – always the same, 
                reliable, clear. Sometimes he's bored because he can already read and do math. 
                But he's also found friends, discovered hobbies, and his love for LEGO is boundless.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today Sam is a joyful child full of energy, interests, and feelings. 
                He marvels at the world, discovers something new every day, and shows us 
                again and again how special his view of life is.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>This is Sam. Our son. Unique, wonderful – and the inspiration 
                for this website.</strong>

    <h2>Preface</h2>

    <div class="intro-grid">
        <div class="intro-text">
            <p><strong>Welcome.</strong></p>

            <p>
                My name is Paul. Together with my wife Katharina and our two children 
                Sam and Johanna, we're walking our own family path.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sam is 7 years old and has autism and ADHD. The diagnosis came when he was 4 – 
                and maybe you know that moment: Suddenly everything is different. 
                Many things get a name, but at the same time new questions, 
                worries, and uncertainties emerge.
            </p>

            <p>
                Autism doesn't just change the child's life – it changes the whole 
                family system. Daily life. Expectations. The view of the future. 
                You learn to look more closely, redefine patience, and appreciate 
                small progress.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website is for parents, friends, and grandparents. 
                For everyone who thinks: <em>"Yes, that's exactly how it feels for us too."</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe our experiences, ideas, and decisions will help you better understand 
                your own family life or make it a little more relaxed.
