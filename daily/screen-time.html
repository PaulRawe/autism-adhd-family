    <h2>Our Daily Life – Honest, Warm, and Sometimes Chaotic</h2>
    <p><em>From my perspective – as a father.</em></p>
    <p>First, I need to say this clearly: My wife is an educator. And especially in the educational context, digital screen time is heavily limited – not without reason and also rightly conveyed that way.</p>
    <p>That's part of her training, part of her professional stance, and part of what's recommended for "typical" children.</p>
    <p>And then there's my perspective.<br>That of a father without that degree.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Observations from Daily Life</h2>
    <p>What I see with Sam is this: He gets absorbed in audiobooks just like in real books. He gets absorbed in front of the TV – but only with <strong>familiar, calm series or movies</strong>. Nothing exciting. No quick cuts. No new stimuli.</p>
    <p>Even as a two-year-old, he liked watching educational shows. Always the same ones. With an intensity and persistence that surprised us even then.</p>
    <p>I want to be honest: Screen time in front of the TV is unfortunately – or perhaps simply factually – <strong>very high</strong> at our place.</p>
    <p>But: Sam is happy during it.</p>
    <p>He laughs a lot. He seems relaxed. He absorbs content and later does something with it in play. He's often more balanced afterward than before.</p>

    <h2>The Other Side – Critical Thoughts</h2>
    <p>At the same time, I also have an uneasy feeling. Because Sam shows a very high affinity for television. Almost something you could call an "addictive tendency."</p>
    <p>Additionally: We almost always have an audiobook running during meals. This means that <strong>Sam's digital media time throughout the day is significantly higher</strong> than in many other families.</p>
    <p>From an educational perspective – for a neurotypical child – this is certainly too much.</p>
    <p>And this is exactly the crucial point.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Between Theory and Reality</h2>
    <p>Sam isn't a "normal" child in the educational sense. He processes stimuli differently. He regulates himself differently. And he finds calm through different pathways.</p>
    <p>For him, audiobooks and television aren't pure consumption. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structure</li>
        <li>Predictability</li>
        <li>Regulation</li>
        <li>Security</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All things that help him manage daily life.</p>
    <p>Of course we observe carefully. Of course we limit content. Of course we pay attention to familiar formats and calm stimuli.</p>
    <p>But in the end, what counts for us is: <strong>Anything that sustainably calms Sam without further overwhelming him has its place.</strong></p>
    <div class="quote">Pedagogical rules help – but they don't replace looking closely at your own child.</div>

<section>
    <h2>What the Science Says (Brief & Understandable)</h2>
    <p>Digital media can have a regulating function for autistic children, especially when they're predictable, familiar in content, and designed with low stimulation.</p>
    <p>Studies show that <strong>repetitive, familiar media content</strong> reduces stress and can serve as a co-regulation aid.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it's emphasized that not duration alone, but <strong>content, context, and function</strong> are decisive.</p>
    <p>Media that contributes to calming and subsequently leads to play, communication, or balance has a different effect than passive sensory overload.</p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>
    <p>Screen time can't be evaluated across the board. Especially not for autistic children.</p>
    <p>For us today: Not how much is decisive, but what it does to Sam.</p>
    <p>And if something brings calm, triggers smiles, and afterward play is possible again, then it deserves at least one thing: to be taken seriously.</p>
    <div class="quote">If our experiences help you reevaluate screen time and make decisions based on function rather than rules, then this article has served its purpose.</div>
