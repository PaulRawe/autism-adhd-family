    <h2>Our Daily Life – Honest, Warm, and Sometimes Chaotic</h2>

    <p>
        At first, we didn't understand anything.<br>
        We often thought: <em>"He's just being stubborn."</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        We saw the behavior,
        but didn't understand what was behind it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only when Sam's therapists provided us with information materials
        and individually trained us did we slowly realize
        what was actually happening – and that there wasn't "the one behavior,"
        but rather <strong>very different forms of overwhelm</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The real game-changer came later, though.
    </p>

    <p>
        We started creating a <strong>table</strong>:<br>
        What signs does Sam show before a meltdown?<br>
        Which signs indicate a shutdown instead?
    </p>

    <p>
        We clearly named these signals, discussed them together,
        and established concrete measures:<br>
        What do we do when these signals appear?<br>
        What do we absolutely avoid?
    </p>

    <p>
        In parallel, we worked with Sam – using his <strong>emotion cards</strong> –
        on how he can communicate early,
        before it becomes too much.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, we hung <strong>scales</strong> throughout the house:<br>
        <em>"This is where I am right now."</em><br>
        They help him assess how high his internal stress level is –
        even when words fail.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because what we didn't know before:<br>
        Shortly before a meltdown or shutdown, children on the autism spectrum
        can <strong>lose the ability to speak</strong>
        and can only communicate nonverbally.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        Behavior is communication – even when it becomes loud or silent.

    <h2>Safe Spaces at Home</h2>

    <p>
        We repeatedly offered Sam different safe spaces,
        for example a spot in the garden or the shower.
    </p>

    <p>
        But we found:
        Wherever his younger sister could also go – she was two years old at the time –
        it didn't work.
        She couldn't understand yet what safe spaces meant.
    </p>

    <p>
        That's why Sam got his own safe space in his room <strong>under his loft bed</strong>:
        his cushion and a space curtain.
        It's quiet and structured.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's also a shelf with his books there,
        where he can read or browse when things get too much.
    </p>

    <p>
        What we also noticed:
        The more we understood the condition and Sam,
        and the more we kept to targeted agreements and routines with him,
        <strong>the less he needs his safe space</strong> –
        and the better he feels overall.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Science Says (Brief & Understandable – with Term Explanations)</h2>

    <h3>What is a Meltdown?</h3>

    <p>
        A meltdown is an <strong>uncontrollable stress response</strong>
        to massive overwhelm of the nervous system.
        It's not a tantrum and not conscious behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Typical signs:</strong> loud screaming or crying, running away or dropping to the ground,
        physical restlessness or aggression, complete loss of control.
    </p>

    <p>
        The brain is in survival mode ("fight or flight").
    </p>

    <h3>What is a Shutdown?</h3>

    <p>
        A shutdown is the opposite of a meltdown –
        outwardly calm, but inwardly just as overwhelming.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Typical signs:</strong> withdrawal, freezing, non-responsiveness, loss of speech, absence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here too, the nervous system is overloaded,
        just with a different response strategy.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Speech Can Be Lost</h3>

    <p>
        Under high stress, the prefrontal cortex
        (responsible for speech, planning, and control)
        is temporarily shut down.
    </p>

    <p>
        This explains why children can't speak anymore,
        requests don't register, and discussions are ineffective.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this state, <strong>co-regulation</strong> is crucial,
        not discipline.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Early Warning Signs Are So Important</h3>

    <p>
        Studies show that recognizing early stress signals
        and intervening in time
        significantly reduces the frequency and intensity of meltdowns.
    </p>

    <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    <p>A meltdown isn't failure. Neither Sam's – nor ours.</p>

    <p>It's a sign that things have become too much.</p>

    <p>When we seek to understand behavior rather than judge it, real support emerges.</p>
